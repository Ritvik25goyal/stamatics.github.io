## 1 - Eavesdropping 101 
* **Project Area :** Cryptography

* **Mentors :** Rahul Jha, Ravija Chandel

* **Description :** Most projects on cryptography focus on algorithms but like the great Loup Vailant said, one should never roll their own crypto. We will start with basics of finite fields before diving headfirst into DES and AES. Less time would be spent on the specifics of implementation and more time on the cryptanalysis. Then we will introduce key exchange, and their weaknesses.

  Prerequisites: None

* **Intended Audience :** Y21-Y22

* **Expected Duration :**  10 weeks


* **Expected Weekly Commitment :** 6 hours

## 2 - Some Problems in Combinatorics
 
* **Mentors :** Farzan Byramji

* **Project Area :** Combinatorics


* **Description :** The main goal will be to try solving some problems in combinatorics that seem interesting. Problems of several kinds like enumerative, algebraic, or extremal can be considered. Some of these may have connections to TCS or discrete probability.


     Prerequisites :Some very basic combinatorics (say roughly at the level of Bona's A Walk through Combinatorics or the course CS201) is desirable. More knowledge related to the kind of problems one is interested in tackling (for instance, from Stanley's books for enumerative combinatorics or Alon and Spencer's The Probabilistic Method for some extremal stuff) would be helpful. None of this is strictly necessary (or sufficient) and most things can be picked up as we go along. Some mathematical maturity is perhaps the only essential requirement.


* **Intended Audience :** Y22 and Y21

* **Expected Duration :** 2 - 3 months
 

* **Expected Weekly Commitment :** 3-6 hours

## 8 - From the Discrete to the Continuous and back

* **Mentors :** Nupur Jain 

* **Project Area :** Topology and Combinatorics
* **Description :** The study of topology explores continuous transformations, while combinatorics studies the discrete. The two interact and enrich each other in intriguing ways. In this project, we will take a look at how translating a problem from one of these domains to the other often makes for a more elegant and intuitive treatment. In particular, we will cover a topological proof of Kuratowski's theorem, a combinatorial proof of Brouwer's fixed point theorem, and see how triangulations are powerful tools to understand surfaces. Further topics can be decided based on which direction the interests of the mentees develop.

* **Intended Audience :** All batches are welcome. No prerequisites are required. Elementary knowledge of topology would be useful but can easily be covered in the initial part of the project.

* **Expected Duration :** 8 weeks or more
 
* **Expected Weekly Commitment :**  At least 5 hours.
